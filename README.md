# snallygaster
Tool to scan for secret files on HTTP servers

what?
=====

snallygaster is a tool that looks for files accessible on web servers that shouldn't be public
and can pose a security risk.

Typical examples include publicly accessible git repositories, backup files potentially containing
passwords or database dumps. In addition it contains a few checks for other security vulnerabilities.

As an introduction to these kinds of issues you may want to watch this talk:
* [Attacking with HTTP Requests](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bppr9rbmwz4)

See the [TESTS.md](TESTS.md) file for an overview of all tests and links to further information
about the issues.

Q: I want to contribute / send a patch / a pull request!

A: That's great, but please read the [CONTRIBUTIONS.md](CONTRIBUTIONS.md) file.

Q: What's that name?

A: [Snallygaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snallygaster) is the name of a dragon that
according to some legends was seen in Maryland and other parts of the US. There's no particular
backstory why this tool got named this way, other than that I was looking for a fun and
interesting name.

I thought a name of some mythical creature would be nice, but most of those had the problem
that I would have had name collisions with other software. Checking the list of dragons on
Wikipedia I learned about the Snallygaster. The name sounded funny, the idea that there are
dragon legends in the US interesting and I found no other piece of software with that name.
