TESTS
=====

An overview of tests provided by snallygaster:

Default tests
=============

These tests are enabled by default and usually output information that directly leads to
potential vulnerabilities.


lfm_php
-------

This checks for Lazy File Manager, a one-file php script that allows arbitrary file
operations. It is often placed on compromised webpages.


idea
----

Configuration file for JetBrains, can contain passwords.


symfony_databases_yml
---------------------

Database configuration file (databases.yml) used by older versions of Symfony. These
aren't supposed to be stored within the web root, but sometimes they are.


rails_database_yml
------------------

Database configuration file (database.yml) used by Ruby on Rails. Misconfigurations can
cause these to be readable.


git_dir
-------

When deploying web pages with a Git repository the .git directory may end up being
publicly readable. This allows downloading the full repository.

svn_dir
-------

Identical to git_dir issue, just with Subversion instead of Git.

* [svnscaper - script to download .svn directories](
  https://github.com/hannob/svnscraper)


apache_server_status
--------------------

Apache server-status pages. These can contain visitor URLs and IP addresses of visitors.

* [Sucuri: Popular sites with Apache server-status enabled](
  https://blog.sucuri.net/2012/10/popular-sites-with-apache-server-status-enabled.html)


apache_server_info
------------------

Apache server-info pages. These can contain visitor URLs and IP addresses of visitors.

* [apache.org: Apache Module mod_info](
  https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_info.html)
* [Heise.de: Webserver-Sicherheitsl√ºcke: Heikle Konfigurations- und Statusdaten
  publiziert](
  https://www.heise.de/hintergrund/Webserver-Sicherheitsluecke-Heikle-Konfigurations-und-Statusdaten-publiziert-4971830.html?seite=3)


coredump
--------

Crashing processes on Linux and other unix systems can leave a memory dump file named
"core" that may leak information like passwords.

* [Hanno's Blog: Don't leave Coredumps on Web Servers](
  https://blog.hboeck.de/archives/887-Dont-leave-Coredumps-on-Web-Servers.html)


sftp_config
-----------

Configuration file from the FTP client sublime FTP (sftp-config.json). It turns out
sometimes people accidentally upload the configuration file of their FTP client,
including credentials for their web space.

* [Sucuri: SFTP/FTP Password Exposure via sftp-config.json](
  https://blog.sucuri.net/2012/11/psa-sftpftp-password-exposure-via-sftp-config-json.html)


wsftp_ini
---------

Similar to sftp_config, but for WS_FTP.


filezilla_xml
-------------

Similar to sftp_config, but for FileZilla.


winscp_ini
----------

Similar to sftp_config, but for WinSCP.


ds_store
--------

The Apple OS X file manager Finder creates these files. They may leak directory and file
names.

* [Internetwache: Scanning the Alexa Top 1M for .DS_Store files](
  https://en.internetwache.org/scanning-the-alexa-top-1m-for-ds-store-files-12-03-2018/)
* [ds_stope_exp (recursively download .DS_Store files)](
  https://github.com/lijiejie/ds_store_exp)

php_cs_fixer
------------

Cache file from PHP-CS-Fixer, a codingstyle checker for PHP. This effectively leaks a
directory listing of PHP files. Supports both v2 and v3 formats.


backupfiles
-----------

Backup files and other leftovers from editors. Many editors create files with a ~ or
.bak extension when overwriting a previous version. VIM creates swap files of the scheme
`.[filename].swp`. On crashes EMACS creates `#[filename]#`. All of these are
particularly problematic in combination with PHP, as a file that may contain secrets
will end up on the webspace without a .php extension and thus won't be parsed.

* [FEROSS: 1% of CMS-Powered Sites Expose Their Database Passwords](
  https://feross.org/cmsploit/)


backup_archive
--------------

Complete or partial backups of servers are sometimes left online. This test checks for
common names like backup.tar.gz.

* [Golem.de: Datenlecks durch backup.zip](
  https://www.golem.de/news/websicherheit-datenlecks-durch-backup-zip-1904-140564.html)


deadjoe
-------

The editor JOE creates a file DEADJOE on crashes, which contains content of the
currently edited files. Similar to backupfiles.


sql_dump
--------

This checks for common names of SQL database dumps. These can lead to massive database
leaks.

* [Zeit Online: How 2,000 Unsecured Databases Landed on the Internet](
  https://www.zeit.de/digital/datenschutz/2017-07/customer-data-how-2000-unsecured-databases-landed-online)


bitcoin_wallet
--------------

This scans for bitcoin wallets (wallet.dat) left on servers. While this is rare,
obviously leaking those can come at a high cost.


drupal_backup_migrate
---------------------

The Drupal backup_migrate plugin stores backups of the CMS database in the web folder.
Access is prevented with an Apache .htaccess file, but that does not work on other web
servers.


magento_config
--------------

Magento is a PHP web store that saves its config (including database credentials) in an
XML file called "local.xml". Access is prevented with an Apache .htaccess file, but that
does not work on other web servers.

* [oss-security: Magento leaking of config file local.xml](
  https://seclists.org/oss-sec/2017/q4/141)


xaa
---

xaa files are the output of the "split" command line tool on Unix systems. It's used to
split large files. As large files often contain lots of data these may lead to large
leaks (similar to sql_dump).


optionsbleed
------------

A test for the Optionsbleed vulnerability, in which Apache corrupts the "Allow" header
in a reply to an HTTP OPTIONS request.

* [Fuzzing Project: Optionsbleed - HTTP OPTIONS method can leak Apache's server memory](
  https://blog.fuzzing-project.org/60-Optionsbleed-HTTP-OPTIONS-method-can-leak-Apaches-server-memory.html)

----------

Checks for private keys, usually belonging to TLS/X.509 certificates.

* [Golem.de: Private Keys on Web Servers](
  https://www.golem.de/news/https-private-keys-on-web-servers-1707-128862.html)


sshkey
------

Similar to the privatekey check this looks for SSH private keys on web servers.


dotenv
------

This looks for Laravel ".env" files that may contain database credentials.


invalidsrc
----------

This checks all src-references on a webpage's HTML and looks for inaccessible
references. These may indicate domain takeover vulnerabilities. This test produces
warnings quite often, though many of them are harmless: References to deleted files or
simply syntax errors in URLs.

* [Hanno's Blog: Abandoned Domain Takeover as a Web Security Risk](
  https://blog.hboeck.de/archives/889-Abandoned-Domain-Takeover-as-a-Web-Security-Risk.html)


ilias_defaultpw
---------------

This checks installations of the Ilias e-learning software for the presence of a default
username/password (root/homer). Ilias was involved in the 2018 hack of the German
government, though it's unclear what vulnerability was used.

* [Golem.de: Hack on German Government via E-Learning Software Ilias](
  https://www.golem.de/news/government-hack-hack-on-german-government-via-e-learning-software-ilias-1803-133231.html)


cgiecho
-------

The cgiecho tool is part of the unmaintained software cgiemail. It contains a
vulnerability where it allows leaking arbitrary files from the web root if they contain
any guessable string in square brackets (e.g. `['password']`).

* [Cgiemail - Source Code Disclosure/Local File Inclusion Exploit](
  https://github.com/finbar-crago/cgiemail-exploit)


phpunit_eval
------------

Tests for a remote code execution vulnerability in a script shipped with older versions
of phpunit that will simply pass the POST data to PHP's eval.

* [CVE-2017-9841 RCE vulnerability in phpunit](
  https://web.archive.org/web/20181213234925/http://phpunit.vulnbusters.com/)


acmereflect
-----------

Tests if there's an ACME API endpoint that reflects content and can be abused for XSS.
Outputs acmereflect_html if the API also reflects HTML code, acmereflect_html_sniff if
it outputs HTML code and does MIME sniffing.

* [XSS using quirky implementations of ACME http-01](
  https://labs.detectify.com/2018/09/04/xss-using-quirky-implementations-of-acme-http-01/)


drupaldb
--------

Misconfigured Drupal installations may expose their SQLite database.


phpwarnings
-----------

Tries to trigger a PHP warning with an invalid PHPSESSID.


adminer
-------

adminer is a one file php database frontend. (I may consider changing this to an info
test, but for now I believe most of these are not intentionally publicly available,
though they often have login forms.)

* [Adminer leaks passwords; Magecart hackers rejoice](
  https://gwillem.gitlab.io/2019/01/17/adminer-4.6.2-file-disclosure-vulnerability/)


elmah
-----

Public error console for the ELMAH library. This can contain cookies and other sensitive
pieces of information, it shouldn't be accessible from outside.

* [ASP.NET session hijacking with Google and ELMAH](
  https://www.troyhunt.com/aspnet-session-hijacking-with-google/)


citrix_rce

* [Citrix NetScaler CVE-2019-19781: What You Need to Know (Tripwire VERT)](
  https://www.tripwire.com/state-of-security/vert/citrix-netscaler-cve-2019-19781-what-you-need-to-know/)


installer
---------

Search for unused installers of common PHP web applications. In most cases a stale
installer can be used for code execution by installing the application and uploading a
plugin.


wpsubdir
--------

Search for unused Wordpress installers in /wordpress/ subdir.


telescope
---------

Search for publicly accessible instances of the Laravel Telescope software. This allows
seeing detailed HTTP requests, including Cookies, and thus should never be accessible in
production.


vb_test
-------

vb_test.php is a script provided by the proprietary Vbulletin software that allows
webmasters to check server requirements. It should not be left on live hosts.


headerinject
------------

This tries to inject an url-encoded newline and HTTP header into the URL. This often
works on redirections if the host decodes the path and passes it to the location header.


wpdebug
-------

Publicly accessible debug.log file from Wordpress, contains usually PHP error messages,
sometimes with sensitive data like passwords in stack traces.


thumbsdb
--------

Image metadata from old Windows versions, may leak file names and thumbnails.

* [Vinetto thumbnail parser](https://github.com/AtesComp/Vinetto)


duplicator
----------

Find leftover installer.php / installer-backup.php files from the Wordpress Duplicator
plugin. Note: While this is claimed as "fixed" by the plugin authors in later versions
as the plugin tries to delete these files after the next login, a vulnerable state can
still happen if the files are not successfully deleted after a migration.

* [Synacktiv: Remote code execution vulnerability in WordPress Duplicator](
  https://www.synacktiv.com/ressources/advisories/WordPress_Duplicator-1.2.40-RCE.pdf)

  https://anonleaks.net/2021/optinfoil/kennotfm-details-zu-hack-und-defacement/)


desktopini
----------

Finds Windows Explorer desktop.ini metadata files. These sometimes leak information
about possibly installed software on a developer machine or file names. Impact is
usually low, but it is very common.


postdebug
---------

Some web frameworks show a debugging console when they receive an unexpected HTTP
method. This can often be triggered by sending a POST request to the main page. This
test looks for such debugging consoles from Laravel, Symfony, and Rails.


djangodebug
-----------

Information on 404 error pages can identify Django installations with debugging mode
enabled.


symfonydebug
------------

Similar to djangodebug, information on 404 error pages can identify Symfony
installations with debugging mode enabled.


axfr
----

Checks if name servers answer to AXFR zone transfer requests. These are usually never
intended to be publicly accessible.

* [Internetwache: Scanning Alexa's Top 1M for AXFR](
  https://en.internetwache.org/scanning-alexas-top-1m-for-axfr-29-03-2015/)

  https://bitbucket.org/tildeslash/monit/issues/881/configuration-file-with-default-username)


openelasticsearch
-----------------

Check for open Elasticsearch instances with admin:admin (default password from Open
Distro for Elasticsearch).


Info tests
==========

These tests are enabled with the "-i" parameter. They output information about a site
that may be valuable for analysis, but does not directly indicate a security problem.


drupal
------

Checks for the presence of the Drupal CMS and outputs the version.


wordpress
---------

Check for the presence of Wordpress and output version.


mailman
-------

Check for mailman and output version.


django_staticfiles_json
-----------------------

Checks for the presence of a Django assets manifest file [`staticfiles.json`
](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/ref/contrib/staticfiles/).


composer
--------

Check for composer.json/composer.lock files. Can be checked with the [Symfony security
check](https://symfony.com/doc/current/setup.html#security-checker) afterwards.
